Q: Which classes are aggregates of other classes?
Cart là aggregate của Media (Book, CompactDisc, DigitalVideoDisc)
Store là aggregate của Media
CompactDisc là aggregate của Track

When overriding the equals() method of the Object class, you will have to cast the Object 
parameter obj to the type of Object that you are dealing with. For example, in the Media class, you must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objects’ attributes as the above requirements (i.e. title for Media; title and length for Track). If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
Runtime error

Q: Alternatively, to compare items in the cart, instead of using the Comparator class I have mentioned, you can use the Comparable interface1 and override the compareTo()method. You can refer to the Java docs to see the information of this interface.
Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.
- What class should implement the Comparable interface?
Should implement the Comparable interface in class Media

- In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method to reflect the ordering that we want?
Implement compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we want
public int compareTo(Media media) {   
	return Comparator.comparing(Media::getCost).thenComparing(Media::getTitle).compare(this, media); 
}
Implement compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we want in DigitalVideoDisc
public int compareTo(Media media) {   
	DigitalVideoDisc dvd =(DigitalVideoDisc) media;   
	return Comparator.comparing(DigitalVideoDisc::getTitle).thenComparing(DigitalVideoDisc::getLength).thenComparing(DigitalVideoDisc::getCost).compare(this, dvd); 
}

- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
No

- Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
We can either override compareTo() in DigitalVideoDisc or define a custom Comparator for DVDs.
